## Writing

To start writing a post you should start with "< body >"
Be sure to __close all the tags__ you're using in order to make the markdown work!
<P>To create a new paragraph with a white area in between you need to use the "< p >" code. The text can be written immediately after it. "< br > " can be used to <br> break a text paragraph like this. Thus not ideal for creating whitespace.

To link to a specific post you need __the title of the file__, not of the post! So a link becomes like this: < a href="(curly brackets)baseurl/try-link">Link text</>. Try link is the title of this post file for example. <a href="{{baseurl}}/try-link">Try me.</a> This way of making a link does not need an extra space in the form of "& n b s p ;", but the div pop-up element does. See this example of &nbsp;<div class="thumb"><a href="{{baseurl}}/free-will">Free-will</a><div><div>
            <h2>Post title</h2>
            <p>Ladieda</p>
            <p>It also needs a period right after the the last div closing code.</p>
        </div></div></div>&nbsp; definition.</p>

## Tags
For every tag page you ned to make a new folder and new index html like the original one.
