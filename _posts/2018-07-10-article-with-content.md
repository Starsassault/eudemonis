<span class="firstcharacter">S</span>oday we're going to talk about the purpose of life. Does it have a meaning and why are we here are frequent asked questions by the philosophers.

A lot of times humans are put on top of a hierarchy. But why built a hierarchy in the first place? Why is there a need for a hierarchy? Was it created on purpose by man, or by life? Or did it come into life? Or did it come out of life like everything else.

Everything comes out of life.

Nothing exists besides life, everything is created in this set of parameters that we call life. But what we call life can be much more than only the things we perceive. But if logic and such works here, if we have certain rules here, then they should somewhat be similar "out there". Quantum Physics are not as random as most people are made to believe. It does not justify a God. Nothing justifies anything for that matter. We are matter, and matter exists because we can behold matter. Without eyes there could be nothing. Without it, there could not be anything. As you can see language fails us in every step of the process.

## A will to live
Many people believe in a certain process that allows us to make decisions. Many people believe that what they've made, is done by them. That there is an I and a You. That there are boundaries to everything. A logical reason for this thinking is the belief that we cannot experience how it is to be a plant, or a star, or a single cell of our own organs. So what are we then? Where and what is this so called consciousness? Is our consciousness the mean of all the kinds of consciousness of our individual cells, or atoms? Is everything just a mean?

? In the eyes of biologists consciousness is just a product of biology and nothing more. It is not something of itself, its no end product, it has no purpose like anything else but to survival. consciousness was made with the sole reason because it could and it helped its "host" to survive and thrive better than its predecessor.
